# Baybayin_AI

## Description
This project was originally made back when I was in SHS in 2018-2019.
It uses Python as its primary language along with an attempt to use Java as its GUI wrapper which ultimately did not become very functional, effectively retaining its best functionality on the Python script sourced from EdjeElectronics repository in Object Detection.
