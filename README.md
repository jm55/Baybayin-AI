# Baybayin AI

## Description

A capstone project which uses TensorFlow for Object Detection to detect Baybayin characters in lieu of traditional OCR.

## Components Overview

- Python: Runs the machine learning model which conducts object detection in lieu of OCR for Baybayin character detection.
- Java: Acts as a GUI wrapper for Python (not very well implemented).
